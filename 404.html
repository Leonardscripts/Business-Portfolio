            Hello everyone, My name is Michael. I am a Developer with more then
            a few projects underneath my belt. I am someone who enjoys creating
            and bringing things to life. Feel free to reach out for questions,
            comments or any other contributions i can help you with. Believe it
            or not. Long before i started out in the passion for programming i
            worked in an arrary of different jobs over the years, so i
            definitely have had some insightfull experience's. In a word you can

          <h3>united parcel service</h3>
          <h6>Supply Chain Logistics</h6>
          <p>
            This is one of the many first companies i can remember working for
            that gave me the backbone for discipline, hard work ethics and the
            gain of life time knowledge of what it means to work your way up
            from the bottom of a legitimate Fortune 500 company that has a real
            knack for improvision and sticks with you for life. I had many roles
            over the course of my time spent there. This company is a perfect
            example of what consistency,persistance and timing can lead to.
          </p>

          <h3>Pav-Lak industries</h3>
          <h6>UX/Ui</h6>
          <p>
            This is a company that at heart is the essance of taking something
            good and making it better then what most would hope to accomplish in
            america. I had the priviledge of working here for a short while and
            gained a unique view of what the right attitude can accomplish in
            life.

          <h3>Freelance Development</h3>
          <h6>Full stack Development</h6>
          <p>
            Over the course from mentors and the will to learn while going
            outside of the box, i have been able to meet, help and learn to
            build Projects for buisness's that have given me my core philosphy
            on what it means to truley develop and in a very humbling way. It is
            a good feeling to know that you played a part in solving someone's
            buisness solution. "That stays with you forever".
